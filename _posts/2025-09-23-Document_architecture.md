# Documenting Architecture



How to document architecture?
Architecture for the developer.
Most problems are not technical.

Document decisions. Focus on quality over quantity.
Use architecture pictures when talking to developers.
UML is great but quickly outdated and often not understood.

Speek same language. Language should be found in pictures, in code and in daily meetings.

Architektur versionieren, maschinenlesbar!
